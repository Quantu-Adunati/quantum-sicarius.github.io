 This post will cover some of my personal experiences with the University of Pretoria and my Bsc Computer Science course.

In my early years I had this notion in my head that University is the ultimate achievement. If you get your degree you are all set in life, you will get a high paying job and before you know it you have a successful career.

Forward to 2016 where my journey begins.

It starts off like how I expected it would. Lots of subjects. Lots of hours to put into my studies. The first thing that I realised was if you can do something no one cares unless you got the paper to prove that. I remember coming into my COS 132 (Imperative programming) course thinking "Ok I have never done C++ programming but I have programmed before, I will see how it goes". 3 weeks into my 132 course I realised I am not effectively using my time to attend the lectures as I can self study the content in less time.

So now here is my first complaint: There should be an accelerated first year program, I probably could have started with second semester COS modules.

Forward further into the year to the second semester. We now have a module called COS 110 (Program design: Introduction). In this module we had practicals every week. I was disciplined and completed the practicals till I achieved the maximum possible mark. Every two weeks we would have to do an assignment. These assignments had a massive weight for the module marks. I diligently did these assignments. Now as a trying to be competent programmer I exercise best practices where I can. One being version control using git (<https://git-scm.com/>) and it's related service Github (<https://github.com/Quantum-Sicarius>). Due to my previous programming experience I had many queries from fellow students on the subject. I decided to make my code public. Now TUKS has strict rules on plagiarism (<http://www.ais.up.ac.za/plagiarism/policy_2010.pdf>). It may have been a naive move to make my code public but I believed that I am protected by the university's plagiarism policy.

I kept on updating my repository as time went on (<https://github.com/Quantum-Sicarius/COS110>) I kept trying to achieve my maximum possible mark and I slept with a consious clear of any possbile plagirsm.

By the end of the year they released the assignment and practical marks. I had nearly all zeros. The computer science department uses a modified code plagiarism tester (<http://www.cs.up.ac.za/cs/vpieterse/pub/SACLA2014_plagiarism.pdf>) based on MOSS (<https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/>) turns out people litteraly copied my code and uploaded it. It was bound to happen, with the stress and deadlines people will try take the easy route. Here is where I get F***** by the university: If you believe you got an unfair plagiarism mark you will need to go in for a meeting and prove you are innocent (So you are basically guilty before proven innocent. Breaching the human right of Presumption of innocence). I queried the course coordinator and explained my situation only to get a reply saying "If you made your code available for other students, then you have enabled them to copy your code and to commit plagiarism. By doing that, you are also guilty." At this time I was facing failing the course even though I am completely capable of getting a distinction. I left the matter as they threatened if I was not able to prove that it was mine despite my github page I will have to take it to legal and if I lose I will not be able to study at any South African higher educational institute. I was required to get 77% in my end exam to just pass with a 50%. I didn't pass and had to write the supplementary exam, but due to how the course layout works the assignments still counted to my final mark and I had to achieve a mark of 75% this time to pass.

After much emotional and mental draining I passed the module. I was cheated out of my distinction but atleast I am not banned.

I have lost my respect for the university in general. I have trust issues with my peers and I am permanently looking behind my back incase something like this happens again.
